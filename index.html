        <h3>Council meetings</h3>
        <p>Sheet Parish Council meet on the second Tuesday of every month (except August). Usually meetings are held at
            the Village Hall but due to the Covid-19 pandemic and current Government restrictions the meetings are now
            being held remotely via Teams. Agendas are posted on the village noticeboards outside the village hall and
            in Pulens Lane, as well as on this website, and will give details of how you can join the meetings on-line.
            Our elected representatives from Hampshire County Council and East Hampshire District Council are present at
            most meetings. Members of the public are welcome to attend all meetings and one agenda item allows for brief
            'public comment'.</p>



        <p>The next full meeting of the Parish Council is on Tuesday 13th April 2021 at 7.30pm.
            The agenda for the meeting will be made available  (here) 3-working days prior to the meeting. </p>

            <!--The agenda for the meeting is available <a href="./img/Agenda/March P.C. Meeting 2021.pdf"
                                                      target="blank">here</a>.-->

        <h3>Planning</h3>

            planning meeting which is advertised on noticeboards and the website as above. </p>

        <h3>Minutes of meetings</h3>
        <p>The minutes of Parish Council meetings and any additional Planning meetings are available
            on the <a href="minutes.html">Meeting Minutes</a> page of this website. These are in draft form until

        <h3>Network Rail – Proposed changes to Sheet Level Crossing:</h3>
        <p>As outlined at the Annual Parish Assembly, work to upgrade Sheet Level Crossing will commence over the summer
            holidays.  To understand Network Rail’s proposals for the area please see the

        <h3>Community Funded Initiatives</h3>

        <p>
            As many of you will be aware, Sheet Parish Council has been working on a number of CFI projects over the
            last couple of years – these are aimed at slowing the traffic on the London Road, preventing large vehicles
            accessing Village Street and, more recently, widening the footpath alongside the Church to make it safer for
            pedestrians. We are pleased to report that the following works will be taking place in the coming weeks and
            hope they will not cause too much disruption.
            </p>

        <h3>Council meetings</h3>
        <p> Meetings are usually held on the second Tuesday of the month (except August), in the small meeting room at
            Sheet Village Hall.</br>
            Agendas are posted on the village noticeboards outside the village hall and
            in Pulens Lane, as well as on this website, and will give details of how you can join the meetings.
            Our elected representatives from Hampshire County Council and East Hampshire District Council are present at
            most meetings. Members of the public are welcome to attend all meetings and one agenda item allows for brief
            'public comment'.</p>

        <p>The next full meeting of the Parish Council is on Monday 14th August 2023 at 7.15pm in the small meeting
            room.
        </p>
       <p> The agenda for the meeting is available <a href="./img/Agenda/August2023.pdf

        <h3>Planning</h3>
        <p>Planning matters are normally considered in the full council meeting, but occasionally we hold an additional
            planning meeting which is advertised on noticeboards and the website as above. </p>

        <h3>Millennium Field Wildflower Audit</h3>
        <p>A botanical survey of the Millennium Field was carried out at the beginning of July by Steve Povey, a member
            of the Botanical Society of Britain and Ireland. You will see from the attached report <a
                    href="img/gendocs_2021/Sheet Parish Council - Wildflower Survey - Millennium Field.pdf"
                    target="blank">here </a> that over 76
            species were found.</p>
        <p>Sheet Parish Council is very grateful to Steve Povey and his able assistants, Tony Clear and Bill Lowe, for
            this very interesting piece of work.</p>

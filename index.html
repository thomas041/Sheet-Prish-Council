<!--        <h3>Annual Parish Assembly 2023</h3>-->
<!--        <p>The Annual Parish Assembly will be held on Thursday, 27th April at 7.00 p.m. at Sheet Village Hall.-->
<!--            This year representatives of Network Rail will brief us on the improvement works scheduled to take place at-->
<!--            Sheet Level Crossing in the summer â€“ they will also answer any questions.-->
<!--            Please join us for a chance to meet your Parish, District, and County Councillors over a glass of wine, and-->
<!--            to hear about what has been happening in Sheet and the local area over the past year.-->
<!--<br><br>-->
<!--            <a href="./img/Agenda/APA Poster 2023.pdf">HERE</a> is a link to the poster.-->

<!--        </p>-->


<!--        <h3>Voting for your local Council</h3>-->
<!--        <p>We have elections upcoming in May 2023, and voters will need photo ID to be able to vote in-->
<!--            person at a polling station. Acceptable forms of ID are listed on the Electoral Commission website.</p>-->
<!--        <p>Please ensure you can exercise your democratic right to vote.</p>-->

<!--        </p>-->

<!--        <h3>Cold Temperatures</h3>-->

<!--        <p>You will be acutely aware that we are heading into another prolonged cold snap and temperatures are expected-->
<!--            to remain very low until at least the end of the week. This will have further implications for the Highways-->
<!--            service and it is highly likely we can expect to see more potholes and degradation on our roads, and-->
<!--            especially so given the expected daily freeze-thaw cycle that caused so much damage before Christmas. The-->
<!--            recent heavy rain has added to the service pressures with widespread surface water flooding and high-->
<!--            groundwater still evident in many places, increasing the risk of ice. It is likely that at least two-->
<!--            gritting runs will be required every day until the temperatures rise in order to deal with the continuous-->
<!--            wash-off and the freeze-thaw impact - this has consequential impacts for Milestone's resources as many of-->
<!--            the gritter drivers are also frontline operatives.</p>-->
<!--        <p>The highways team are continuing to work flat out to keep on top of the situation, including working evenings-->
<!--            and weekends, but these current challenges will mean a further re-prioritisation of frontline activity to-->
<!--            ensure resources are directed to where they are most needed. The ongoing issues, together with the impacts-->
<!--            of further wintry weather, means that it could be several months before the frontline service can return to-->
<!--            anything like business as usual activity.</p>-->
<!--        <p>The team are taking urgent steps to update our highway webpages to highlight the peak demand and to inform-->
<!--            users/residents that there may be a delay before lower priority repairs can be actioned. So you are aware,-->
<!--            and to put the current situation into some perspective, over the weekend alone more than 700-->
<!--            reports/enquiries were received!</p>-->
<!--        <p>Milestone are endeavouring to scale up their resources through their supply chains to meet the heightened-->
<!--            demand but most, if not all, of the regional authorities are trying to secure the same resources as their-->
<!--            networks also deteriorate.</p>-->
<!--        <p>Ice is a considerable challenge in some parts of the County this morning. There are road closures in place-->
<!--            and you can see the latest situation with traffic via the ROMANSE map which you can find <a-->
<!--                    href="https://romanse.org.uk/">here:</a></p>-->
<!--        <p>The better news is that we are now less likely to see any snowfall in Hampshire, but the team will remain-->
<!--            vigilant, monitoring forecasts so that if the weather does deteriorate, we are in the best possible shape to-->
<!--            respond.</p>-->

        <h3>Millennium Field Wildflower Audit</h3>
        <p>A botanical survey of the Millennium Field was carried out at the beginning of July by Steve Povey, a member
            of the Botanical Society of Britain and Ireland. You will see from the attached report <a
                    href="img/gendocs_2021/Sheet Parish Council - Wildflower Survey - Millennium Field.pdf"
                    target="blank">here </a> that over 76
            species were found.</p>
        <p>Sheet Parish Council is very grateful to Steve Povey and his able assistants, Tony Clear and Bill Lowe, for
            this very interesting piece of work.</p>

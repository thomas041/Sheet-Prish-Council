        <h3>IMPROVEMENTS TO SCHOOL LANE/FARNHAM ROAD JUNCTION</h3>
        <p>As many of you will be aware, the work to replace the crumbling steps and extend the pavement down School Lane
            to a tactile pedestrian crossing point whilst narrowing the entrance to School Lane is almost finished - the
            planned resurfacing, which will complete the project, has unfortunately been delayed by a couple of weeks due
            to unavoidable complications arising from the persistent leak from the water main further up Farnham Road.
        </p>

        <p>
            The new layout should also have the added benefit of slowing traffic through the village.
        </p>

        <p>Sheet Parish Council are grateful to Alex Hawkins, the Project Engineer, for his perseverance and hard work on the Scheme.
        </p>

            <h3>Resurfacing of London Road</h3>
            <p>
                Sheet Parish Council has been advised by HCC that the work currently being undertaken by SSE on the
                London Road has been delayed and extended.
            </p>
            <p>Consequently HCC have had no choice other than to postpone their planned resurfacing works until next
                year. Residents should receive an update letter from HCC in the next few days.</p>

					<h3>EHDC Play areas</h3>
					<p>All play areas around the district will be closed until further notice.</p>
				</div>

				<div class="news">

					<h3>Car parks</h3>
					<p>We have been asked if we will relax car parking charges. Abolishing car park charges at this stage
						could encourage more visitors to the area, which would be against the government’s policy of social distancing.

<!--					<h3>Bulky waste collections</h3>-->
<!--					<p>New bulky waste bookings have been suspended until further notice. Norse South East will complete-->
<!--						existing requests provided that the waste is left outside your property for the crew to collect. </p>-->
<!--				</div>-->

				<div class="news">
					<h3>Fly-tips and street litter bins</h3>
					<p>It may take longer than usual to clear reported fly-tips and empty street litter bins. </p>
				</div>

<!--				<div class="news">-->
<!--					<h3>Rubbish, recycling and garden waste collections</h3>-->
<!--					<p>We are currently working as hard as we can to keep your rubbish and recycling collections running as scheduled.-->
<!--						However, we may need to prioritise domestic waste (green bin) collections as the situation with the COVID-19 continues.-->

<!--						We will endeavour to collect your recycling (black bin) and garden waste (brown bin) on your regular day,-->
<!--						but this is likely to become increasingly difficult.</p>-->

<!--						<p>Please put your bins out as normal on your scheduled collection day. Please leave your bin out all day-->
<!--						as the crews may be running later than usual. If your bin is not collected please leave it out,-->
<!--						where it will not cause an obstruction, and our teams will collect as soon as they can.-->
<!--						This may not be until your next scheduled collection day.-->
<!--						We will collect excess recycling which can be left in clear plastic sacks or a cardboard box next-->
<!--						to your bin. If your rubbish collection is missed, we will collect any extra rubbish which can also-->
<!--						be left in sacks next to your bin.</p>-->

<!--						<p>We will continue to update our website and social media pages regularly so please keep an eye out-->
<!--						for service updates in your area.</p>-->

<!--						<p>For people suffering with symptoms associated with coronavirus (COVID-19) or self-isolating at home,-->
<!--						please follow <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-decontamination-in-non-healthcare-settings/covid-19-decontamination-in-non-healthcare-settings"-->

        <p>Sheet Parish Council has received the resignation of Dave McKinney with great sadness.
            Although Dave had only been with us for a relatively short while, he had achieved a
            great deal in that time and will be sadly missed.  </p>
          <p> The process of seeking a replacement has been started <a href="./img/generalDocs2023/Sheetvacancy.pdf"

        <h3>Update on Sheet Parish Priorities Statement – Completion date for the survey is Friday 22nd September
            2023.</h3>

        <p>
            Sheet Parish Council is responding to the South Downs National Park Authority’s (SDNPA) local plan review by
            consulting everyone in the Parish. The Parish Priorities Statement survey is a great opportunity for you to
            inform the SDNPA of your priorities and the future of the Parish.<br>

<br>
            The survey feedback will be analysed and the Council will hold an open session at the village hall to allow
            for final comments before the results are submitted to the SDNPA.<br>
<br>
            The survey needs to be completed and returned by Friday 22nd September 2023.

<br>
            Survey responses can be posted at the village hall (survey box) or by scanning and emailing them to our
            clerk Jenny Hollington at                 <script type="text/javascript">

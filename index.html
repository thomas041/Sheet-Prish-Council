                Kerbside glass collection update: please continue to bear with us
            </h3>

            <p>We wanted to let you know as soon as possible that we've decided not to reinstate the kerbside glass
                collection service just yet - but that this will be the last time that it's suspended.
            </p>

            <p>We initially took the decision to suspend it for a month because we wanted to prioritise collecting your
                waste, recycling and garden waste during the ongoing national driver shortage. But despite a recruitment
                campaign for drivers and loaders, Norse SE needs more time to get its teams up to full capacity.
            </p>

            <p>
                To help Norse SE further we have today instructed them to increase driver pay once again (the second
                time in just over a month) - so it will be £16 an hour and loader pay will now be £12.50 an hour - which
                shows that we are pulling out all the stops to ensure this service gets back on track as soon as
                possible.
            </p>

            <p>
                We are really sorry for the inconvenience this is causing and thank you so much for your ongoing
                patience - we really are doing everything we possibly can to help Norse SE recruit.
            </p>

        <h3>Hampshire County Council is seeking the views of residents about 20 mph limits within Hampshire.</h3>
        <p>The County Council is keen to hear from as many residents, businesses and other stakeholders as possible, to
            find out their views on the implementation of 20mph limits in the context of other highways priorities and
            the County Council's statutory duties to maintain the highway in a safe condition within a limited
            budget. </p>

        <p>The findings from the survey, together with data about use of the highway, speed enforcement, road safety and
            environmental impacts will be important in helping to shape future policy relating to 20mph speed limits in
            Hampshire and, in turn, future decision-making around 20mph speed limits. The survey is available
            <a target="_blank"
               href="https://www.hants.gov.uk/transport/transportschemes/20mph-speed-limits-consultation"> here </a>
            and should take just 15 minutes to complete. </p>

        <p>It is open until midnight on Monday 12 September 2022.

            Sheet Village Hall.</br>
            Agendas are posted on the village noticeboards outside the village hall and

            'public comment'.</p>

        <h3>Planning</h3>

            of the Botanical Society of Britain and Ireland. You will see from the attached report <a
                    href="img/gendocs_2021/Sheet Parish Council - Wildflower Survey - Millennium Field.pdf"

            species were found.</p>
        <p>Sheet Parish Council is very grateful to Steve Povey and his able assistants, Tony Clear and Bill Lowe, for
